                <h4>Developing MVP Mobile App for your startup</h4>
                <p>For a long time Android has been neglected among startups and developers but over past few years it grew and grew, to become a leader in the mobile world with over 1 billion active users. Access to such a huge segment of the population seems like a great opportunity, especially for mobile startups trying to develop their MVP and easily reach a broader audience. We are perfectly aware of how crucial it is for startups to deliver their first product to the market and test the initial business hypothesis. With a deep understanding of Lean Startup methodology we will advise you on what is the best possible combination of features that will go along with current Android trends. Moreover, our team offers complete support and maintenance of developed applications so that you can focus on your customer success and user engagement.</p>

            <h4>Frameworks and technologies we use for Android development</h4>
            <p>We take the whole process of software engineering seriously. We use only sterling libraries and reliable solutions for Android development  to guarantee solidness(dependability). Therefore our applications are covered with Roboelectric unit tests to automate as much work as possible. If something happens to go wrong, we let Crashlytics handle it, which makes finding and fixing bugs a lot faster and efficient.  By using Android Studio to develop apps, with Gradle as a build tool, we are able to smoothlycreate proper project's structure that can be easily maintained, developed and supported in the future. Understanding importance of communication within the team as well as keeping track of progress, we use Asana, JIRA and Teamwork, all designed to enable succesful teamwork.</p>
