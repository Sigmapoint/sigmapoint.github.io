SDK for iOS and Android that allows developer to place advertisements in his app (like Google AdMob or Apple iAd). It uses our partnerâ€™s custom Ad Server and is compatible with Mraid v2 specification. Besides the ad displaying framework itself we also created bridge for WebView that enables two-way interaction between our mraid.js library and native code for both iOS and Android.
