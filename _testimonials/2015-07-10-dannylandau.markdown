opinion: Sigmapoint is the preeminent software development firm in Poland. They demonstrate a rare combination of technical expertise, problem solving skills and overall professionalism that can take an idea and create a fully fledged product within a short period of time.  As far as I know, probably the only firm that provides the same combination of skills and knowledge as Pivotal Labs in U.S. but affordable. If you are a client, consider yourself fortunate, and if you are Sigmapoint, hope they only take on projects that they find worthwhile and inherently interesting.
