Loyali is a mobile loyalty program. Loyali includes mobile app for iOS and web dashboard that enables shop owners to send PUSH notifications based on target & demographics. The whole system will be integrated with Estiomte Beacons API - small, wireless sensors that use Bluetooth low energy (BLE) to detect the location of nearby smartphones and communicate (in development).
