            <h4>Frameworks and technologies we use for Android development</h4>
            <p>We take the whole process of software engineering seriously. We use only sterling libraries and reliable solutions for Android development  to guarantee solidness (dependability). Therefore our applications are covered with Roboelectric unit tests to automate as much work as possible. If something happens to go wrong, we let Crashlytics handle it, which makes finding and fixing bugs a lot faster and efficient. By using Android Studio to develop apps, with Gradle as a build tool, we are able to smoothly create proper project's structure that can be easily maintained, developed and supported in the future. Understanding importance of communication within the team as well as keeping track of progress, we use Asana, JIRA and Teamwork, all designed to enable successful teamwork.</p>

            <h4>Frameworks and technologies we use for iOS development</h4>
            <p>With iOS being one of the leading mobile platform, it is vital to ensure its appropriate treatment. In iOS apps our developers create pixel-perfect UI following Human Interface Guidelines. We love Constraints and AutoLayout so our apps scale easily on iPhones and iPads. With responsiveness in our mind we utilize top Appleâ€™s technologies like CoreData, GCD background queues and push notifications to make your app work smoothly and be rock solid. If something goes wrong anyway, we let Crashlytics hold our back.</p>
